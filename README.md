# @matthewcpp/webgl

This is a simple to use framework for creating small graphics demos using WebGL2.

### Getting Started

The [@matthewcpp/webgl-samples](https://github.com/matthewcpp/webgl-examples) repo contains detailed example scenes showcasing the framework's features.

### Building
The framework is built using rollup.  [gl-matrix](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) is configured as an external dependency. 
To build the distribution bundle run the following command:
```shell script
npm run build
```
This will produce an es6 module and accompanying typescript definition file.
